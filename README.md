# Push Swap

This project implements a sorting algorithm to efficiently sort numbers in a stack, with limited and minimal operations.

It takes a list of integers as input and sorts them in ascending order using two stacks, named A and B. The goal is to perform a series of operations on the stacks to achieve the desired sorting.

## Algorithm

The algorithm i used is a combination of sorting techniques, including Radix sort, to efficiently sort the list of integers.

## Installation

To compile the Push Swap program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/push_swap.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd push_swap`
3. Compile the program: `make`

## Usage

To use the Push Swap program, follow these steps:

1. Run the program with a list of integers as arguments: `./push_swap 5 2 8 1 4`
2. The program will output a series of operations to perform on the stacks to achieve the desired sorting.
